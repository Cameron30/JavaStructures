# JavaStructures
A collection of labs and projects for a secondary Java course.

The project takes in a csv file of Mesonet data, and displays the information on an interactive map of Oklahoma that is colored by county. Each variable can be chosen, then the counties are shaded accordingly.

Lab 13 is the coolest lab, with dynamically drawn Sierpinski Triangles displayed on the screen.
